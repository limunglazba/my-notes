## Class Variables
- Class variables can be accessed through class itself or through class instances 
  - When trying to access an attribute: Python will first check if an instance contains that attribute. If it doesn't, it will check if its class (or a class it inherits from) contains it. [[1]](https://youtu.be/BJ-VvGyQxho?t=214)
